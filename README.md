## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use a radial gradient with tailwind CSS. I also got more practice making cards and adjusting the spacing.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn how radial gradients work, and how to elegantly insert them with tailwind because radial support does not exist. This makes adding gradients into tailwind more difficult.
